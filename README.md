# React Application overview 

React project with simple CRUD operation [Shoe zoom](https://shoe-zoon.web.app/).

* This is a fully responsive React application. In this application users can order a product. But Before login, if user click on the "Buy now" button he/she will redirect to the login page. Because this route us protected from random user. After login he/she will redirect to the place order page. Here I use React router dom version 6.

* Users can see their All order in MyOrders Route. If users want to delete her/his order they can do it. At this time a confirmation alert will popup or surety.

* Here is an dashboard route. Only admin can see and access this route. In this route, Admin can manage all the users Orders. If admin want to delete any order, He/She can delete any order also admin can approved order by clicking the approved button. 

* In dashboard admin can add product in database. After adding the product, it will appear in the featured route. Also admin can manage all the product from dashboard. He/She can delete any product from featured product. 

* Admin can make admin another existing user from dashboard.
